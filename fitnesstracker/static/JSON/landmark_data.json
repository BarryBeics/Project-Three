Plans to construct the castle in 1284 were delayed due to lack of funds and work only began in 1295 following the Madog ap Llywelyn uprising. Beaumaris Castle was taken by Welsh forces in 1403 during the rebellion of Owain Glynd\u0175r but recaptured by royal forces in 1405.<br>Here are half a dozen interesting facts about Beaumaris Castle:<br><br> 1. Wales was divided into counties and shires, emulating how England was governed, with three new shires created in the north-west, Caernarfon, Merioneth and Anglesey. New towns with protective castles were established at Caernarfon and Harlech, the administrative centres of the first two shires. Another castle and walled town was built in nearby Conwy and plans were probably made to establish a similar castle and settlement near Llanfaes on Anglesey.<br><br> 2. Beaumaris Gaol is a disused jail located in the castle grounds.
