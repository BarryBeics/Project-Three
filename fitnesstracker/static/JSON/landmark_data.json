The build of this now famous 27.7 metre tall South Stack lighthouse was subsequently commissioned on the 30-metre summit of this rocky outcrop.<br><br> As would be expected the weather hindered the operation on many occasions. To add spice to the build men and materials had to be swung down a rope sliding basket onto the island. Indeed it wasn\u2019t until 1828 that a connecting iron suspension bridge was built at a cost in excess of \u00a31000.<br><br> The construction of this magnificent lighthouse must have been very demanding, technically challenging and extremely dangerous for the builders of the day.<br><br> Please take a moment to watch this short video and imagine arriving at South Stack on a beautiful, calm summer\u2019s evening:<br>", "longitude": -4.6994, "latitude": 53.3066}]
